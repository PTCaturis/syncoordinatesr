# 'Syncoordinatesr' package

The 'syncoordinatesr' is a package useful to generate synthetic coordinates for your database. 
Inspired by the research article of Thaís Paiva https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.6078
and the masters dissertation of Letícia Nunes http://est.ufmg.br/portal/arquivos/mestrado/dissertacoes/dissertacao_Leticia_Silva_Nunes.pdf
the package contains functions able to generate synthetic coordinates using the method explained in both articles.

## Installing the package

The package, in this moment, can't be found on CRAN and your installation has to
be done via github. To do this you must have already installed the package *devtools*
so you can use the function **install_github**

´´´´R
devtools::instal_github("leogalhardo/syncoordinatesr")
´´´´
